# Type of Operators

# An operator is a symbols that performs a certain operation between
# operands.

# Arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, %, **)
# Relational operations (==, <=, >=, !=, >, <)
# Assignments Operatore (= , +=, -=, /=, %=, %=, **=)
# Logical operators (not, and, or)



# Arithmetic operations

# a = 121
# b = 10
# c = 120
# d = 4
# e = 3


# print(a+b)
# print(a-b)

# print(a*b)
# print(a/b)

# print(a%b) 
#   # Reminder
# print(a**b)   # a^b


# print(d**e)  # 4*4*4






# Relational operations

a =15
b = 10
c =15
d = "10"

#  =  ==


# print(a == b)  

# print(b == d)


# print(a >= c)
# print(a <= b)

# print(a != b)


# Assignments Operatore

d = 10  #Asssigned integer

d = d + 20  #10+20 = 30

# print(d)

d +=20
# print("num", d)
#  # Assigned integer ==> 90

a = 5
# a= a-2
 
a -=2
# print(a)

a *=2 
# print(a)

a /=5
# print(a)
 
a %=2 # 2%2
# print(a)






# print(

# d -= 30
# print("num", d)

# d /= 10
# print("num", d)


d **= 5 # 2*2*2*2*2
# print("num", d)


#  Logical operators (not, and, or)

num1 = 50
num2 = 30

# print ("dfsdf")
# print (not True)

# print(not (num1>num2))

# && ||
