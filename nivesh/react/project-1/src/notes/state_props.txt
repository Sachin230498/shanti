What is State in React?
In React, state refers to an object that stores dynamic data specific to a component and controls how that component behaves. When the state changes, React re-renders the component, displaying the updated data. It allows components to respond to user inputs, server requests, and other interactions.

State is local to the component, meaning it can only be used within that component. Itâ€™s mutable (can change) and affects how the component is rendered.

Handling State Using the useState Hook
In functional components, state is managed using the useState hook, which is a function that allows you to add state to these components. The useState hook returns two values:

The current state value.
A function to update the state value.



Syntax of useState

const [state, setState] = useState(initialValue);
state: The current value of the state.
setState: A function that updates the state.
initialValue: The starting value for the state.
